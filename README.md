Sepia Go 1.0.6 modified to work without servers.

## Compiling the APK on Windows

(if you don't have java already, install it. it needs to be in your env path.)

1. get an apk of Sepia Go 1.0.6
2. rename the apk to `baseapk.apk`
3. move the renamed apk to the repository
4. run compile.bat
5. you now have the funny patched apk!!! enjoy

You will also need to disable play protect on devices with a google account (since google really doesn't like resigned apk files)
